# Todo App Built with Web Components

This is just an experiment to see what using [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) and no frameworks is like.

The goal is to build a [Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com) app (minus the styling).

The main APIs being used here are [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry/define) that use [HTML templates elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template).

It runs in the browser if you just load index.html.
